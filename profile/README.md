# Welcome! ðŸ™‚
Valen Sandbox is a Garry's Mod sandbox server that has been around in some form since June 2019. Over time, this has basically just become a one-man hobby project to provide a unique open-source Gmod experience that I haven't quite found on other servers (also to tear apart other people's code and play around with GLua lol).

You can find our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/xSqMRgjcpq) and our Steam group [here](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/valensandbox).

Enjoy!

## Contribution
PRs are greatly appreciated! In general, please use [this glualint config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valen-Sandbox/.github/main/.glualint.json) for your linter when editing any repositories under this organization unless one is already included in the project you're editing. Also, please send your improvements upstream so that more people can benefit from them, and I will try to do the same where possible. Thank you!
